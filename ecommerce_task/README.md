E-commerce App

My Approach
I built this Flutter app to create a simple shopping experience. The app has three main parts:

Product List: Shows all available products in cards with images and prices
Product Details: When you tap a product, it opens a detailed view with description
Cart Feature: Users can add items to cart and get confirmation messages

I used Flutter's basic widgets like ListView for the product list, GestureDetector for tap handling, and Navigator for moving between screens. The app follows a simple structure with separate files for the main app, screens, and product data.
